    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>We collect non-personally-identifying information such as browser type, language preference, referring site, and date/time of each request to better understand how visitors use our site.</p>
    <p>We may also collect IP addresses for logged-in users and commenters, disclosed only under the same conditions as personally-identifying information.</p>

    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Some interactions may require personally-identifying information, such as usernames and email addresses for account creation or contact forms.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use commercially acceptable means to protect your data, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Advertisements</h2>
    <p>Ads may be served by partners who use cookies to deliver targeted content. This policy covers our use of cookies, not those of advertisers.</p>

    <h2>Protection of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>We disclose personal data only to employees, contractors, and affiliates who need it to provide services and have agreed to confidentiality. We do not sell personal data.</p>

    <h2>Communications</h2>
    <p>Registered users may receive occasional emails about updates or features. We aim to keep such communication minimal and relevant.</p>

    <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
    <p>We may collect and share aggregated, non-personal statistics about visitor behaviour. These do not include personally-identifying information.</p>

    <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Some links may be affiliate links. We may earn commissions, but this does not affect your purchase price.</p>
